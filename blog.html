                    <h1>REPUBLIC DAY CELEBRATION</h1>
                </div>
                <p>Republic Day is a national holiday in India commemorating the adoption of the Constitution of India,
                    and the country's transition to a republic which came into effect on 26 January 1950.

                    The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the governing document of India, thus
                    turning the nation from a dominion into a republic post its independence from the British Raj in
                    1947. The constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and came
                    into effect on 26 January 1950. The date was chosen as the Indian National Congress proclaimed Purna
                    Swaraj (complete independence) on this day in 1930.

                    Republic Day is commonly associated with parades, political speeches, cultural events and
                    ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history,
                    government, and traditions of India.</p>

                    <h1>TEACHERS DAY CELEBRATION</h1>
                </div>
                <p>As stated previously, Teachers’ Day commemorates the remarkable life of Dr. Sarvepalli
                    Radhakrishnan[1], a distinguished scholar, philosopher, and the second President of India. His
                    outstanding contributions to education and philosophy have left an indelible mark on India’s
                    intellectual landscape. Dr. Radhakrishnan firmly believed knowledge was the guiding light for
                    personal and societal progress. Interestingly, he showed extraordinary humility when his students
                    proposed to celebrate his birthday. He suggested that, instead, the day should honor teachers – the
                    often unsung heroes who tirelessly impart knowledge and wisdom to countless young minds. This
                    gesture of reverence for educators transformed his birthday into Teachers’ Day, a day dedicated to
                    celebrating those who shape not only the intellect but also the character of future generations.</p>

                    <h1> CHILDREN'S DAY CELEBRATION</h1>
                </div>
                <p>Children's Day is marked by expressions of love, gifts and pampering of students. Teachers in schools
                    organise special programs and performances for students which also include competitions such as
                    quizes, debating, painting , singing and dancing. As a part of the celebrations and festivities,
                    exchange of gifts like books and cards also takes place. This year students of national capital,
                    Delhi will be devoid of any celebrations in school as the state government has closed schools until
                    November 18 in view of rising pollution levels across the city. Children's Day in India was
                    initially observed on November 20 which is the day when United Nations celebrates World Children's
                    Day. However, after Jawaharlal Nehru's death in 1964, the Indian Parliament passed a resolution to
                    commemorate Nehru's birthday as Children's Day. </p>

                </div>
                <p>This year will signify the twelfth commemoration of National Sports Day. The selection of August 29
                    as the date stems from its alignment with the birth anniversary of the illustrious field hockey
                    player, Major Dhyan Chand. In observance of National Sports Day, the Government of India bestows a
                    variety of accolades and distinctions upon both teams and individual players. These sports champions
                    are acknowledged for their notable contributions to the field, and a formal ceremony is conducted at
                    the Presidential Palace, where the President of India confers these diverse awards.

                    As an individual, you have the opportunity to orchestrate and engage in sports events that resonate
                    with your interests. You can form a team with your friends or take part in school-organized events
                    that are arranged in honour of National Sports Day.</p>
